            <h4>I'm Helen Flockhart an artist and a contemporary painter!</h4>
            <p5>Helen Flockhart is a Scottish postwar & contemporary painter who was born in 1963.
                She studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art, as well as at the State Higher School of Fine Arts in Poznan. 
                The worlds that Helen Flockhart creates are rich in references to familiar myths, legends, and literature. 
                We come across in her paintings, do not have a continuation, but they look not so much strange as peaceful.As Flockhart says of her work, she hopes to "create a sense of peace, an offering of calm, a sense of omen."
                Whether it's vast apocalyptic wastelands or thickly patterned, claustrophobic interiors,
                Helen's paintings show her highly personalized vision, which the artist uses through a specialized oil paint layering technique.
                "My paintings are inspired by an inexhaustible concern for human conditions. I try to use the original relevance of an idea conceived on paper,
                fixing it on canvas with a deliberate and careful layering of texture, pattern and rhythm, intertwining threads of both personal and mythological."
